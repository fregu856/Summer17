Install Linux (Ubuntu Mate) on the RPI:  
http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/sbc_software.html (See 6.1) (Download the file, burn the image onto the micro-sd card using e.g. Etcher, insert micro-sd into RPI, power it up and follow the instructions (need HDMI cable and usb mouse & keyboard))  

Enable SSH:  


If one would like to have the RPI and computer connected to the same router and send wifi data that way, you might have to make the following modifications in order to be able to connect to the RPI via ssh:  
- Add the line "IPQoS 0x00" to the bottom of the files "/etc/ssh/ssh_config" and "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" on the RPI and then reboot it.

Another problem you might run into is that you can't install anything using pip on the RPI. The solution is, strangely, to set the date and time properly:  
- $ sudo date -s "Jul 7 18:31" (where you replace "Jul 7 18:31" with your current date and time)
