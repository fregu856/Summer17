### Setup: Raspbian RPI (for video streaming, communication with the laptop and actuator control)

Install the latest verison of Raspian:
- Download Raspbian with desktop: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
- Write the downloaded image to the micro-SD card: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
- Insert micro-SD into the RPI, power it up and follow the instructions (need HDMI cable and usb mouse & keyboard)

Enable SSH, the camera and I2C:
- Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Config > Interfaces
- Click "Enabled" for Camera, SSH and I2C
- Restart the RPI

Setup the RPI as a wifi hotspot:
- https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd

(If one would like to have the RPI and computer connected to the same router and send wifi data that way, you might have to make the following modifications in order to be able to connect to the RPI via ssh:  
- Add the line "IPQoS 0x00" to the bottom of the files "/etc/ssh/ssh_config" and "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" on the RPI and then reboot it.)

Another problem you might run into is that you can't install anything using pip on the RPI. The solution is, strangely, to set the date and time properly:  
- $ sudo date -s "Jul 7 18:31" (where you replace "Jul 7 18:31" with your current date and time)

### Setup: Ubuntu RPI (for reading the LiDAR)

Install Ubuntu Mate:  
http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/sbc_software.html (See 6.1) (Download the file, burn the image onto the micro-SD card using e.g. Etcher, insert micro-SD into RPI, power it up and follow the instructions (need HDMI cable and usb mouse & keyboard)) (Choose a username and password of your liking, you'll use it to SSH into the RPI)

Install ROS:
- $ sudo apt-get update
- $ sudo apt-get upgrade
- $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros_kinetic.sh && chmod 755 ./install_ros_kinetic.sh && bash ./install_ros_kinetic.sh

Setup and test the LiDAR:
- $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-hls-lfcd-lds-driver
- $ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0 (do this when the LiDAR is plugged into the RPI, YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERYTIME YOU RESTART THE UBUNTU RPI!)
- $ roslaunch hls_lfcd_lds_driver hlds_laser.launch (the LiDAR should now start turning and publish messages to /scan, check this with the command $ rostopic echo /scan)

Enable SSH:
- $ sudo apt-get install raspi-config rpi-update
- $ sudo raspi-config
- Select "Interfacing Options"
- Select "SSH", select "Yes"
- Reboot to confirm the changes

Make it connect to the WiFi network of the Raspian RPI on boot:  
- Press on the WiFi symbol and select "Edit Connections"
- Select the RPI network and click Edit
- Below "General", make sure that "Automatically connect to this network when it is available" is selected
- Edit any other networks you previously have connected to and make sure that "Automatically connect to this network when it is available" is NOT selected

### Setup: Laptop

Install ROS:
- TODO!

Install needed ROS packages:
- Catkin:
- - TODO!
- TODO!

Install required packages:
- OpenCV
- TODO!

Create a catkin workspace (placed in Summer17/Laptop/ROS_code):
- $ cd Summer17/Laptop/
- $ mkdir ROS_code
- $ cd ROS_code
- $ mkdir catkin_ws
- $ cd catkin_ws/
- $ mkdir src
- $ cd ~/Summer17/Laptop/ROS_code/catkin_ws
- $ catkin_make
- $ source ~/Summer17/Laptop/ROS_code/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
- Add the above line (source ~/Summer17/Laptop/ROS_code/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash) to the bottom of ~/.basrhrc ($ sudo nano ~/bashrc to open and edit it) for it to be run everytime you open a terminal


****

Setup of ROS IP addresses:
- Connect both the laptop and the Ubuntu RPI to the Raspian RPI wifi
- SSH into the Ubuntu RPI (to do this you need its IP address, you obtain this by running $ ifconfig when it's connected to the Raspbian RPI wifi. Its  IP address is found as "inet addr" below "wlan0". In my case I got: 172.24.1.57)
- Note the laptop's IP address (by running $ ifconfig. In my case I got: 172.24.1.72) 
- In the Ubuntu RPI terminal:
- - $ sudo nano ~/.bashrc
- - Replace the second-to-last line "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311" with "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://172.24.1.72:11311" (where 172.24.1.72 is the IP address of the laptop)
- - Replace the last line "export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost" with "export ROS_HOSTNAME=172.24.1.57" (where 172.24.1.57 is the IP address of the Ubuntu RPI)
- - $ source ~/.bashrc
- In the laptop terminal:
- - $ sudo nano ~/.bashrc
- - Add the following two lines to the bottom of the file: "export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://172.24.1.72:11311" and "export ROS_HOSTNAME=172.24.1.72" (where again, 172.24.1.72 is the laptop's IP address)
- - $ source ~/.bashrc

- To test that everything works:
- - [Laptop terminal 1] $ roscore
- - [Ubuntu RPI terminal] $ roslaunch hls_lfcd_lds_driver hlds_laser.launch (the LiDAR should now start spinning, it might however take a few seconds)
- - [Laptop terminal 2] $ rostopic echo /scan (a stream of scan messages should now start appearing in the terminal)
